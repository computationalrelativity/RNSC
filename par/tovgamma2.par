# This is a test parfile
# The file parser is very stupid:
# - it will ignore lines starting with '#' , and 
# - it will look for strings '<key>=<value>'
# be sure not to format properly the parfile and do not leave spaces ...
#
# example for spherical polytropic star with gamma=2 and rho_central = 1.28e-3
# these are actually the default parameters
#
rns_verbose=2
rns_save_2ddata=1
outputdir=tovgamma2
# be also sure not to leave blank lines after this.
